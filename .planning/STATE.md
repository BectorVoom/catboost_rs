# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-13)

**Core value:** A memory-efficient, Rust-native CatBoost implementation with verifiable feature parity (oracle-tested ≤1e-5), embeddable in Rust and droppable into both scikit-learn and existing CatBoost Python pipelines.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Workspace, Lint Discipline & Oracle Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Workspace, Lint Discipline & Oracle Harness)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-13 — Roadmap created (8 phases, 62/62 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phased by oracle-passing vertical slices, narrowest-first (research-mandated); each phase must be oracle-passing ≤1e-5 vs upstream before the next begins.
- Roadmap: CPU path fully oracle-locked (through Phase 6) before GPU (Phase 7); GPU is additive on the generic `R: Runtime` boundary established in Phase 3.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 5 (Ordered Boosting/CTR), Phase 7 (GPU/CubeCL-ROCm), and Phase 8 (Python ABI/packaging) are flagged NEEDS DEEPER RESEARCH — run the per-phase research spike before planning each.
- GPU tolerance epsilon (Phase 7) is unspecified — must be set and signed off before Phase 7 planning.
