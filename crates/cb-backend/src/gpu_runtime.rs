//! Generic device launch helpers over [`crate::SelectedRuntime`] (D-7.1-04).
//!
//! This is the Phase-7.1 GPU analog of [`crate::cpu_runtime`]: it mirrors that
//! file's per-call client construction, `bytemuck`/`Bytes` host<->device transfer,
//! and WR-05 typed-error read-back, but is parameterized over the compile-time
//! selected runtime so the SAME launch path serves `cpu`/`wgpu`/`cuda`/`rocm`
//! (D-7.1-01). It hosts the Phase-7.1 device primitives — a block sum reduction
//! ([`launch_block_reduce_f64`], used by the `kernels::reduce` rocm self-oracle)
//! and the block inclusive/exclusive prefix-scan ([`launch_block_scan_f64`], used
//! by the `kernels::scan` rocm self-oracle, GPU-01 scan / D-7.1-06).
//!
//! # Reduction contract (D-7.1-05 / Open Q1)
//!
//! [`block_reduce_kernel`] folds each cube's slice into ONE partial; this helper
//! returns the per-cube partials UN-summed. The parity-critical FINAL fold is the
//! host's job (`cb-core::sum_f64`, the frozen sequential order), exactly as the
//! elementwise gradient kernels leave the leaf reduction to the host (D-02). This
//! default finalize carries NO atomic-float dependency (the in-kernel
//! atomic-finalize variant is Plan 02), so it builds and runs regardless of
//! f64-atomic support on a given backend.
//!
//! # Wave-size policy (D-09)
//!
//! `use_plane` is queried ONCE host-side from
//! `client.features().plane.contains(Plane::Ops)` and passed as the kernel's
//! `#[comptime]` flag, selecting the plane fold or the shared-memory fallback at
//! JIT time. No warp/wave-size literal appears in the kernel reduction stride.
//!
//! # Error handling (T-7.1-02 / WR-05)
//!
//! A device read-back failure is mapped to a typed [`CbError::Degenerate`], never
//! a silent all-zero buffer that would masquerade as a valid reduction. No
//! `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/indexing in this production file (workspace lints + D-13).
