//! First-class `#[cube]` compute kernels for the CPU backend (D-01/D-03).
//!
//! Every kernel here does ONLY order-independent, per-element work (D-02/D-06):
//! one output element per thread, indexed by [`ABSOLUTE_POS`], guarded by a
//! bounds check. Kernels NEVER perform a float reduction (sum/scan) — all
//! parity-critical reductions are finalized host-side through `cb-core::sum_f64`
//! in the frozen sequential order (D-02/D-05). This preserves the Phase-2
//! reduction invariant so CubeCL's parallelism cannot drift the 1e-5 oracle bar.
//!
//! Kernels are generic over `F: Float` (AGENTS.md generics-float rule) — no
//! float type is hard-coded in a kernel signature.

/// multiple without reading out of bounds (T-03-00-01 mitigation).

/// This kernel does NO reduction (D-02): the per-object gradients it emits are
/// later summed host-side via `cb-core::sum_f64` when building histograms / leaf
/// values in the Wave-1 training slice.
